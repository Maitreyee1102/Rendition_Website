** Guide To Implementation of Google Form Submission **
1. After clicking on the submit button, it is sending a confirmation mail to the user from the backend using nodemailer
2. Create a new Google Form for the website submission that must not contain any section otherwise it is very hard to fill out a 
   multi-page google form without API Scripts and Backend. (Check the one below for more clarity)
   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbu5bGRRBq-szOgRf6f9jySSOqkefpq4t-uBMSwHzd4qi3yA/viewform?usp=sharing
3. Update the access of who can fill the form to anyone with the link.
4. Copy the URL and paste it in the code.
5. Change the endpoint from /viewform to /formResponse for it to accept the request.
   Ex. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../viewform?usp=sharing to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../formResponse
6. After form creating, link it to the sheets in the Response section.
7. Get the Pre-Filled URL of Google form as mentioned in steps in another step.
8. Update the <entry.ID> in the Form.jsx -> submitForm().
9. Check if the role names are same everywhere (Form.jsx, constants, any other place) and questions are in proper index as mentioned
   in Form.jsx
10. Test it by sending the request.
   Command - await fetch(baseUrl, { method: "POST", body: pageData, mode: "no-cors" });

(I have not applied Google Form Submission Using a Backend as Free-Service backend take time to start and this can provide bad experience
 to any user. If get proper Backend, apply it)


** Get Pre-Filled URL of a Google Form **
1. Create a Google Form and open it.
2. Click on the 'More'(Three-Dot) option on the top-right corner of the window.
3. Click on the option 'Pre-filled form'
4. Fill out all the required details and create the pre-filled URL.
5. Copy the URL and get the respective <entry.ID> for each questions.
6. In Code, a variable is used to store each <entry.ID> for better understanding and clarity, so use it for better clarity and usage.

** Things to Keep in mind while creating your next form **

1. Avoid using Google account login/authentication as it can probid automation apply.
2. Do not permit the form to capture the email. Set up a different question for email so you may get it's <entry.ID>
3. Create 2 Different Google forms for registration. One for website that must not contain any section and One for circulation
   that may or may not contain sections.

** Things to Try **
1. We can fill out a Google Form more easily using Google Apps Script API but when integrating it, it was throwing error that 
   can not be resolved (Tried a lot). So, TRY IT AGAIN IF IT WORKS.
